# FFA320-Connector

This plugin adds a link between the FlightFactor A320 
internal variables to X-Plane Commands and Datarefs.
You can define own commands or Datarefs in the config.cfg.

## Installation

The folder FFA320Connector must be placed in the A320\plugins 
folder, or in the main X-Plane\Resources\plugins folder.

## Building the FFA320 Connector

To build the FFA320 Connector, you need Visual C++ 2013 or
later. I am searching for someone who is able to compile it
for Mac / Linux. Leave me a message at the X-Plane forums.
